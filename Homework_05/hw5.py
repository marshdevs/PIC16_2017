Challenge 1 corrcoeff(x,y)
Write a function that two vectors of length n as input (representing two variables at n observations),
and outputs the correlation coefficient between them.

Challenge 2 degree(N) and strength(N)
Write a function that takes a (possibly weighted) network as input, and outputs two vectors, one of
which gives the degree or strength (respectively) of each node, and one which ranks the nodes by
degree/strength, highest to lowest.
. . . . . . . . .
Challenge 3 pagerank(N)
Write a function that uses linear algebra from numpy that takes a (possibly weighted, directed network)
as input, and outputs two vectors, one that gives the score for each node, and one vector that
ranks the nodes from highest pagerank score to lowest.
. . . . . . . . .
Challenge 4 similarity(T)
Write a function that takes a set of tweets (given as a list of one string for each tweet), and outputs a
network where the edges represent the similarity between pairs of tweets, based on common words.
Think about different ways to compute this score.
