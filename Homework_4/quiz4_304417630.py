"""
Write a function that takes as input a gray-scale image. For convenience, we assume that the image
takes the form of an n Ã— m numpy array, where each pixel is represented by a single real number
between 0 and 1, representing the gray scale from black to white.
Your function darkens only the top half of the image a little. You can let the amount of darkening be
a parameter of your function.
