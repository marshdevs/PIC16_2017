Final Project 1: Flood-It!

You have two weeks to complete the final project. You will hand in your well-commented .py files.
You will also hand in a .pdf with a report that explains the problem, and explains how your function
works. The report should contain pseudo-code. The report should be such that a python programmer
could read it and understand how to create the program from scratch, without too much actual code.

For all projects, there are many resources on the internet, and even codes that others have written.
You may read these, but you are not allowed to use anyone else’s code directly in yours. The final
projects should be doable using mostly tools and modules from the class. Please check with me if
you are not sure whether you are allowed to use a new command or module.

Become familiar with the game Flood-It!. Then, write a version of this game yourself in python.

• The player should be able to choose both the board size and the number of colors.

• Your game should start in a random state.

• The hard part: Instead of the player playing against a fixed number, as you do in most apps of
this game, you will let the player play against the computer. The number of moves the player
needs to beat, is the number of moves that the computer would need if it played the game using
a greedy algorithm. This number will depend on the starting configuration of the board.
